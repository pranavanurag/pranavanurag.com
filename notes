i want to create a service which
    given an image, file name and descrpition
    does the following
        - renames the file to the desired name
        - creates _thumb version of the photo
        - updates photos_meta.json
        - syncs these changes to the server
^^ notebook.ipynb does most of this. rsync stuff todo

subproblems
- syncing anything to the server (be it an image file, the thumb, or the update photos_meta)
- creating a thumbnail from the og pic
